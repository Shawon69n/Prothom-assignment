        <p>
            What i want to become is a Professional web developer.It's not a thing that i can achive in a few days or weeks.It needs a lot of time and hard work.Developing the habit of trying your hardest and doing your best work is something that will help you succeed throughout your life.  If you look at the quotes below,  "If you can work develop this same habit  to do your best in any situation  it will be a great benefit to your family, career, school and community.  The choice is yours".So I'm gonna work hard until i achive my goal.
